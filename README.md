# 🧩 A2 – Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in C++

This folder contains a collection of C++ programs created as part of the **A2 batch activity**.  
Each program demonstrates a core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concept and includes its **Definition, Applications, and Advantages** for better conceptual understanding.

## 📂 Folder Overview

**Folder Name:** `A2`  
**Language Used:** C++  
**Objective:** To understand and implement key OOP concepts through individual code examples, each documented with theoretical context.

Each `.cpp` file contains:

- The **definition** of the respective OOP concept
- Its **applications** in real-world scenarios
- The **advantages** or benefits of using that concept
- A working **C++ program** demonstrating the topic

## 🧠 Educational Purpose

Each program includes:

- **Definition** — A brief explanation of the concept.
- **Applications** — Real-world use cases or scenarios where the concept applies.
- **Advantages** — Key benefits and reasons to use the concept in software development.

Together, these programs provide a complete theoretical and practical understanding of **OOP principles in C++**.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this activity, students will:

- Understand the **four pillars of OOP**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- Learn how to **reuse, organize, and manage code** efficiently.
- Gain practical knowledge of **error handling, code reusability, and operator behavior**.
- Strengthen programming logic with **real-world examples** of C++ features.
